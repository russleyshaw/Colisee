/*
 Rounded borders should be square
 It should follow an actual color scheme (molokai for example). For example, rarely when there are dark themes, is the background actually BLACK (0x000000). It is usually a sort of dark grey. Similarly with whites, very rarely are they truely white. I highly recommend finding color scheme and sticking to it
 Thinner borders
